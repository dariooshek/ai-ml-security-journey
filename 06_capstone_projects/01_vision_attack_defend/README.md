# Capstone 1 — Vision: Attack → Defend

## Goal
Train a small CNN on CIFAR-10, evaluate baseline, craft adversarial examples (FGSM/PGD), then implement defenses (adversarial training or input preprocessing).

## Tasks
- Data + baseline (PyTorch)
- Attacks with ART/CleverHans
- Defense & evaluation
- Report using templates/NOTEBOOK_TEMPLATE.md

## Success Criteria
- Before/after robustness metrics
- Clear threat model and limitations
